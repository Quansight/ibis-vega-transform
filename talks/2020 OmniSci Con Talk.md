## Title

Using Altair, Ibis, and Vega for interactive exploration of OmniSci databases

### Description

Altair is a lovely tool that let's you build up complex interactive charts
in Python. Ibis is a also a lovely tool that lets you use a Pandas like API
to compose SQL expressions in OmniSci and other backends. By tying them together
you can use the familiar syntax of Pandas, combined with the expressive power of Vega
and Vega Lite, to visualize large amounts of data stored in OmniSci. This talk will walk
through a number of examples of using this pipeline and then go through how it works.
